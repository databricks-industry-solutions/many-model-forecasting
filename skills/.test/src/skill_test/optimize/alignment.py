"""MemAlign integration for aligning judges with human feedback.

MemAlign aligns judges with human feedback via dual-memory:
  - Semantic memory: generalizable evaluation principles
  - Episodic memory: specific edge cases and corrections

Alignment traces are stored per-skill in:
    .test/skills/<skill>/alignment_traces.yaml

Populated via ``scripts/review.py --align`` where a human corrects
judge verdicts. MemAlign learns principles from corrections,
improving judge accuracy over time.

Only 2-10 examples are needed for visible improvement.
