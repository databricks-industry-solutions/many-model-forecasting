# Many Model Forecasting by Databricks Labs

Bootstrap your large scale industrial forecasting solution on Databricks with Many Models Forecasting (MMF) Labs Project!

MMF can significantly accelerate the development of your Sales or Demand Forecasting solution by automating all phases of the ML lifecycle. 
This includes data exploration, preparation, training, backtesting, scoring, and deploying.
It follows the configuration over code approach and requires no coding from the users.
MMF can model hundreds or thousands of time series at the same time leveraging Spark's powerful compute and brings together multiple well-known algorithms (local statistical models, global deep learning models, etc.) and libraries.
The Project also has an extensible architecture and allows users with technical skills to bring in their models and algorithms.
Get started now.

To run this solution, clone this repo into a Databricks workspace. Attach the RUNME notebook to any cluster running a DBR 11.0 or later runtime, and execute the notebook via Run-All. 
A multi-step-job describing the accelerator pipeline will be created, and the link will be provided. Execute the multi-step-job to see how the pipeline runs.
