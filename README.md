# Many Model Forecasting by Databricks Labs

## Introduction

Bootstrap your large scale forecasting solution on Databricks with Many Models Forecasting (MMF) Labs 
Project.

MMF accelerates the development of Sales / Demand Forecasting solution by automating all phases of the ML lifecycle. 
This includes data exploration, preparation, training, backtesting, scoring, and deployment.
It follows the configuration over code approach and requires no coding.
MMF can model hundreds or thousands of time series at the same time leveraging Spark's powerful compute.
It brings together many well-known and state-of-the-art algorithms (local statistical models, global deep learning models, etc.) 
and libraries. 
The Project has an extensible architecture and allows users with technical skills to bring in their models and 
algorithms.

## Getting started

To run this solution using a public [M4](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yogesh94/m4-forecasting-competition-dataset) 
dataset, clone this MMF repo into Databricks Repos.

Attach the [01_mm_forecasting_demo.py](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/01_mm_forecasting_demo.py) 
notebook to any cluster running a DBR 11.2 ML or later runtime. 
You can choose the models to train on your input data by specifying them in a list:
```python
active_models = [
    "StatsForecastArima",
    "StatsForecastETS",
    "RDynamicHarmonicRegression",
    "RFableEnsemble",
    "GluonTSTorchDeepAR",
    "GluonTSNBEATS",
    "GluonTSProphet",
    "SKTimeLgbmDsDt",
    "SKTimeTBats",
]
```
A comprehensive list of models currently supported by MMF is available in the [models_conf.yaml](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/forecasting_sa/models/models_conf.yaml). 
Now, run the forecasting using ```run_forecast``` function with the ```active_models``` list specified above:
```python
run_forecast(
    spark=spark,
    train_data="train",
    scoring_data="train",
    scoring_output="forecast_scoring_out",
    metrics_output="metrics",
    group_id="unique_id",
    date_col="ds",
    target="y",
    freq="D",
    data_quality_check=False,
    ensemble=True,
    ensemble_metric="smape",
    ensemble_metric_avg=0.3,
    ensemble_metric_max=0.5,
    ensemble_scoring_output="forecast_ensemble_out",
    train_predict_ratio=2,
    active_models=active_models,
    experiment_path=f"/Shared/fsa_cicd_pr_experiment",
    use_case_name="fsa",
)
```
See the notebook for the detail descriptions of the parameters. But in a nutshell, ```train_data``` is the input data set, 
```scoring_output``` is a delta table where you want to write your forecasting output into, ```metrics_output``` is a 
delta table where you want to write metrics from all backtest windows from all models into, and ```active_models``` is a 
list of models you want to use. 
To configure the model parameters, change the values in [base_forecasting_conf.yaml](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/forecasting_sa/base_forecasting_conf.yaml). 

MMF is fully integrated with MLflow and so once the training kicks off, the experiments will be visible in the MLflow UI.
