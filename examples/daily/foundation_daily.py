# MAGIC # Many Models Forecasting Demo
# MAGIC This notebook showcases how to run MMF with foundation models on multiple time series of daily resolution. We will use [M4 competition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207019301128#sec5) data.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Cluster setup
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We recommend using a cluster with [Databricks Runtime 15.4 LTS for ML](https://docs.databricks.com/en/release-notes/runtime/15.4lts-ml.html). The cluster should be single-node with one or more GPU instances: e.g. [g4dn.12xlarge [T4]](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/g4/) on AWS or [Standard_NC64as_T4_v3](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series) on Azure. MMF leverages [Pandas UDF](https://docs.databricks.com/en/udf/pandas.html) for distributing the inference tasks and utilizing all the available resource.

# MAGIC ### Install and import packages
# MAGIC Check out [requirements-foundation.txt](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/requirements-foundation.txt) if you're interested in the libraries we use. For foundation models, additional dependencies are installed and imported as per demand. See how this is done in `install` function defined in each model pipeline script: e.g. [mmf_sa/models/chronosforecast/ChronosPipeline.py](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/mmf_sa/models/chronosforecast/ChronosPipeline.py).

    y_df, _, _ = M4.load(directory=str(pathlib.Path.home()), group="Daily")
    _ids = [f"D{i}" for i in range(1, n+1)]
    y_df = (
        y_df.groupby("unique_id")
        .filter(lambda x: x.unique_id.iloc[0] in _ids)
        .groupby("unique_id")
        .apply(transform_group)
        .reset_index(drop=True)
    )
    return y_df

        df = df.iloc[-1020:]
    _start = pd.Timestamp("2020-01-01")
    _end = _start + pd.DateOffset(days=int(df.count()[0]) - 1)
    date_idx = pd.date_range(start=_start, end=_end, freq="D", name="ds")
    res_df = pd.DataFrame(data=[], index=date_idx).reset_index()
    res_df["unique_id"] = unique_id

# COMMAND ----------

display(
  spark.sql(f"select * from {catalog}.{db}.m4_daily_train where unique_id in ('D1', 'D2', 'D3', 'D4', 'D5') order by unique_id, ds")
  )

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Models
# MAGIC Let's configure a list of models we are going to apply to our time series for evaluation and forecasting. A comprehensive list of all supported models is available in [mmf_sa/models/README.md](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/mmf_sa/models/README.md). Look for the models where `model_type: foundation`; these are the foundation models we install from [chronos](https://pypi.org/project/chronos-forecasting/), [uni2ts](https://pypi.org/project/uni2ts/) and [timesfm](https://pypi.org/project/timesfm/). Check their documentation for the detailed description of each model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Foundation time series models are pretrained on millions or billions of time series. These models can produce analysis (i.e. forecasting, anomaly detection, classfication) on an unforeseen time series without training or tuning. You can modify the hyperparameters in [mmf_sa/models/models_conf.yaml](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/mmf_sa/models/models_conf.yaml) or overwrite the default values in [mmf_sa/forecasting_conf.yaml](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/mmf_sa/forecasting_conf.yaml). You can also introduce new hyperparameters that are supported by the base models. To do this, first add those hyperparameters under the model specification in [mmf_sa/models/models_conf.yaml](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/mmf_sa/models/models_conf.yaml). Then, include these hyperparameters inside the model instantiation which happens in the model pipeline script: e.g. `ChronosT5Tiny` class in [mmf_sa/models/chronosforecast/ChronosPipeline.py](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/mmf_sa/models/chronosforecast/ChronosPipeline.py).

# COMMAND ----------

active_models = [
    "ChronosT5Tiny",
    "ChronosT5Mini",
    "ChronosT5Small",
    "ChronosT5Base",
    "ChronosT5Large",
    "ChronosBoltTiny",
    "ChronosBoltMini",
    "ChronosBoltSmall",
    "ChronosBoltBase",
    "MoiraiSmall",
    "MoiraiBase",
    "MoiraiLarge",
    "MoiraiMoESmall",

    "TimesFM_2_0_500m",
]

# MAGIC %md ### Run MMF
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now, we can run the evaluation and forecasting using `run_forecast` function defined in [mmf_sa/models/__init__.py](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/mmf_sa/models/__init__.py). Refer to [README.md](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/README.md#parameters-description) for a comprehensive description of each parameter. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Note that we are not providing any covariate field (i.e. `static_features`, `dynamic_future_numerical`, `dynamic_future_categorical`, `dynamic_historical_numerical`, or `dynamic_historical_categorical`) yet in this example. We will look into how we can add exogenous regressors to help our models in a different notebook: [examples/external_regressors/foundation_external_regressors_daily.py](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/examples/external_regressors/foundation_external_regressors_daily.py).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While the following cell is running, you can check the status of your run on Experiments. Make sure you look for the experiments with the path you provided as `experiment_path` within `run_forecast`. On the Experiments page, you see one entry per one model (i.e. ChronosT5Large). The metric provided here is a simple average over all back testing trials and all time series. This is intended to give you an initial feeling of how good each model performs on your entire data mix. But we will look into how you can scrutinize the evaluation using the `evaluation_output` table in a bit. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If you are interested in how MMF achieves distributed inference on these foundation models using Pandas UDF, have a look at the model pipeline scripts: e.g. [mmf_sa/models/chronosforecast/ChronosPipeline.py](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/mmf_sa/models/chronosforecast/ChronosPipeline.py).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC One small difference here in running `run_forecast` from the local model case is that we have to iterate through the `active_models` and call the function written in a [separate notebook](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/examples/run_daily.py). This is to avoid the CUDA out of memory issue by freeing up the GPU memory after each model. Make sure to provide `accelerator="gpu"` as an input parameter to `run_forecast` function. Also, set the parameter `data_quality_check=True` and `resample=False`,or provide a complete dataset without missing entries to avoid issues with skipped dates.

# COMMAND ----------

# The same run_id will be assigned to all the models. This makes it easier to run the post evaluation analysis later.
run_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

for model in active_models:
  dbutils.notebook.run(
    "../run_daily",
    timeout_seconds=0, 
    arguments={"catalog": catalog, "db": db, "model": model, "run_id": run_id, "user": user})

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Evaluate
# MAGIC In `evaluation_output` table, the we store all evaluation results for all backtesting trials from all models. This information can be used to understand which models performed well on which time series on which periods of backtesting. This is very important for selecting the final model for forecasting or models for ensembling. Maybe, it's faster to take a look at the table:

# COMMAND ----------

display(
  spark.sql(f"""
    select * from {catalog}.{db}.daily_evaluation_output 
    where unique_id = 'D1'
    order by unique_id, model, backtest_window_start_date
    """))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC For foundation models, we use the same pre-trained model to produce the as-if forecasts for all back testing periods. See how MMF implements backtesting in `backtest` method in [mmf_sa/models/abstract_model.py](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/mmf_sa/models/abstract_model.py).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We store the as-if forecasts together with the actuals for each backtesting period, so you can construct any metric of your interest. We provide a few out-of-the-box metrics for you (e.g. smape), but the idea here is that you construct your own metrics reflecting your business requirements and evaluate models based on those. For example, maybe you care more about the accuracy of the near-horizon forecasts than the far-horizon ones. In such case, you can apply a decreasing wieght to compute weighted aggregated metrics.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Note that if you run local and/or global models against the same time series with the same input parameters (except for those specifying global and foundation models), you will get the entries from those models in the same table and will be able to compare across all types models, which is the biggest benefit of having all models integrated in one solution.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We also register the model in Unity Catalog and store each model's URI in this table (`model_uri`). You can use MLFlow to [load the models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.pyfunc.html#mlflow.pyfunc.load_model) and access their specifications or produce forecasts.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once you have your foundation models registered in Unity Catalog, you can deploy them behind a real-time endpoint on [Model Serving](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/index.html). You can then generate a multi-step ahead forecast at any point in time as long as you provide the history with the right resolution. This could be a game changing feature for applications relying on real-time tracking and monitoring of time series data. See the notebooks in [databricks-industry-solutions/transformer_forecasting](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/transformer_forecasting) for examples of how to register and deploy a model, and make an online forecasting request on that model. 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Forecast
# MAGIC In `scoring_output` table, forecasts for each time series from each model are stored. Based on the evaluation exercised performed on `evaluation_output` table, you can select the forecasts from the best performing models or a mix of models. We again store each model's URI in this table (`model_uri`).

# COMMAND ----------

display(spark.sql(f"""
    select * from {catalog}.{db}.daily_scoring_output 
    where unique_id = 'D1'
    order by unique_id, model, ds
    """))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Refer to the [notebook](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/many-model-forecasting/blob/main/examples/post-evaluation-analysis.ipynb) for guidance on performing fine-grained model selection after running `run_forecast`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### Delete Tables
# MAGIC Let's clean up the tables.

# COMMAND ----------

#display(spark.sql(f"delete from {catalog}.{db}.daily_evaluation_output"))

# COMMAND ----------
